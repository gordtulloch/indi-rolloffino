Modified May 1, 2021 to account for changes to the referenced web page.

To build the rolloffino roof driver, development libraries and
3rdparty driver build files are needed. If you do not already have the
current development files installed, see the directions in the web page below.

https://indilib.org/forum/general/210-howto-building-latest-libindi-ekos.html.
Section 1 Contains the normal INDI install directions.
Section 2 Install the development libraries. You do not need to follow the 
          build libindi unless you intend to run using your own INDI build.
Section 3 Install the libraries and perform the git clone. No need to go
          beyond the clone.

In addition to the libraries already installed, install libindi-dev

Now obtain the rolloffino driver and Arduino source file examples.

Following on from the example of using ~/Projects as the work area in the
above directions:

cd ~/Projects/indi-3rdparty
git clone https://github.com/wotalota/indi-rolloffino.git
mkdir indi-rolloffino/build
cd indi-rolloffino/build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
sudo make install 

This will build and install the indi_rolloffino roof driver. It
will then be available for selection in Ekos using the profile editor 
in the Dome section.

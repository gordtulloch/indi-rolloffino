To build the rolloffino roof driver, the INDI 3rdparty driver build files are needed. To obtain them see the directions in section 3 of the following web page, up to and including the git clone command.

https://indilib.org/forum/general/210-howto-building-latest-libindi-ekos.html.

Following on from the example of using ~/Projects as the work area in the above directions.

cd ~/Projects/indi-3rdparty
git clone https://github.com/wotalota/indi-rolloffino.git
mkdir indi-rolloffino/build
cd indi-rolloffino/build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
sudo make install
